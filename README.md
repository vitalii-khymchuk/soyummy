## Student Project "SoYummy"
Hello! 👋

We are students from the "WALKTEAM" group at GOIT Academy. 🚀

After completing the "Fullstack Developer" course, we needed to solidify 📌 the knowledge and skills we acquired by implementing 📃 a practical project within 14 days.

🎨 Our project received design mockups for the "SoYummy" website, including three versions: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

🛠️ We were also provided with a project specification detailing the website's functionality.

👨‍🎓 The project involved the work of 12 developers. Each of us worked on individual tasks as well as shared tasks, which were assigned and supervised by the Team Lead, with the assistance of the Scrum Master:

**Our goal** was to create a website that matched the design mockup and fulfilled all the tasks specified in the project specification. The main purpose of the website is to display culinary recipes, popular categories, add new recipes, search for specific recipes, and allow users to organize their recipe collections, manage their lists of added/favorite recipes, and create a shopping list for ingredients.

✅ **Throughout the project, we:**

Practiced teamwork using Git.
Utilized the Scrum methodology.
Reinforced our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Applied the ReactJS skills we acquired during the course.
Mastered the use of the Tailwind CSS library.
As a result of our collaborative efforts 🤝, our project was successfully completed.
